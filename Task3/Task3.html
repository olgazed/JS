			Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,<br>
    		So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br>
    		Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
    		In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br>
    		Nativity, once in the main of light,<br>
    		Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,<br>
    		Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,<br>
    		And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<br>
    		Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<br>
    		And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,<br>
    		Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,<br>
    		And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br>
    		And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,<br>
    		Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.<br>
